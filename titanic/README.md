### Predict survival on the Titanic using Excel, Python, R & Random Forests

> **In this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive.** 
In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.

### How to approach:
The above titanic problem have two folders
* *data:* This folder contains two data set files in csv format. One is 'train.csv' which is used to train the model and 
the 'test.csv' which is used to test the model.
* *solution:* This folder contains the R program file and other visualizations which will help to understand the solution.


**Note:**The actual problem is taken from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) and 
Solution is inspired from [David Langer](https://github.com/EasyD/IntroToDataScience)
